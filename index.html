                <h3>Map Opens Up With Time</h3>
                <p>Metroidvania games turn the game world into a map, which has blocked passageways and doors that
                    require keys or other tools. The player must hunt down those objects, which then expand the map and
                    allow the gamer to progress further.</p>

                <h3>Game is All About Exploration</h3>
                <p>Metroidvania games require the gamer to hunt for an object and use that item to move further in the
                    game. This requires searching and traveling in areas that normally the player wouldn’t go, and makes
                    the game feel like it has more depth.</p>

                <h3>Story and Level Design Work Together</h3>
                <p>Because every metroidvania game is a puzzle, a cohesive story is required to entice the player to
                    continue forward. This makes the experience more immersive than a traditional side-scroller, but
                    less so than a modern open world game.</p>

                <h2>Metroidvania</h2>
                <p>The term “metroidvania” is a portmanteau of the two video games that defined the genre: Metroid
                    (1986) and Castlevania (1986). It shares the action game style of 2-D platformers like Metroid,
                    with the same vertical travel options. However, it had a deeper RPG aspect to the game, with
                    additional collectible items.</p>

                <h2>Metroidvania</h2>
                <p>With the appetite among gamers for titles which offer a challenge, along with the rise of
                    nostalgia-fuelled retro-styled games, the Metroidvania genre is not likely to be fading anytime
                    soon. The indie game market, seeing unprecedented popularity, is all too happy to cater to this
                    niche. So you can expect to see a lot more variations on this subgenre in the future which,
                    probably, is not a bad thing.</p>
